# PyBGMM: Bayesian inference for Gaussian mixture model

More coming...

## Overview
Approximation inference (Bayesian inference) for finite Gaussian mixture model (FGMM) and infinte Gaussian mixture 
model (IGMM) includes variational inference and Monte Carlo methods. Here we only use Monte Carlo methods. In 
particular, we use collapsed Gibbs sampling to do the inference.

## Code Structure
